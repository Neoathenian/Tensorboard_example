# Tensorboard_example

This is code I want to share with friends on the basic stuff I learned while researching Tensorboard.

YouÂ´ll have to install Tensorboard using a pip install (ChatGPT can give instructions).

In vs code I think there might be an extension. To use it, use ctrl+shift+P then search for the Tensorboard to start it up (it will open a tab in vs code). Then you can simply open it in a browser.
